<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all arrangers, passengers and others who access or use the Service. The use of any service provided by KURO implies acceptance of these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service. </p>
<p><strong>Offers &amp; Reservations</strong></p>
<p>KURO will provide quotes including price estimates for services free of charge. Once a quote is accepted by the Customer, KURO will provide a written confirmation of the reservation. The acceptance of the offered service proposal by both parties shall be considered a binding contract between KURO and the Customer within the framework of these Terms, unless otherwise specified. </p>
<p>Rates quoted prior to service are only an initial estimate of the cost of services reserved. Wait time and/or additional services including incidentals may change the final price. Incidentals may include, but are not limited to, chauffeur hotel accommodations and meals, greeter fee, parking, port fee, special requests, and tolls. </p>
<p><strong>Cancellation Policy</strong></p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, reservations may be cancelled without charge up to 24 hours before scheduled service begin. Reservations cancelled after this cutoff time will be billable in full. Changes occurring less than 24 hours before service begin may be subject to additional charges. All Special Event Change and Cancellation Policies supersede standard Change and Cancellation Policies and are noted in the email confirmation. </p>
<p><strong>Prepayment &amp; Creditworthiness</strong></p>
<p>KURO is entitled to require cost and delivery advances from the Customer. KURO is entitled to require a prepayment from the Customer prior to the provision of services for any reason including but not limited to if after conclusion of the contract circumstances become known which are likely to substantially reduce the creditworthiness of the Customer and which appear to create a risk of payment of open receivables by the Customer to KURO under the Terms. This applies in particular if the Customer is already in arrears of payments to KURO. </p>
<p><strong>Late Changes</strong></p>
<p>Any changes to the initially agreed upon itinerary may lead to additional charges. Unless otherwise specified, all hourly/as directed services will be billed with at least the minimum of 2 hours. </p>
<p><strong>No-Show Fee</strong></p>
<p>A no-show fee equal to the total trip cost plus applicable waiting time will be charged, should the passenger fail to cancel the service or meet the chauffeur at the designated pick up location for all reservations. </p>
<p>If the passenger cannot locate the driver at the designated meeting area, the passenger or a Customer representative must contact KURO before the passenger leaves the designated meeting area, in order to avoid being charged. </p>
<p><strong>Liability</strong></p>
<p>In no event will KURO or any of its subcontractors or affiliates be liable or responsible for damages of any kind caused by any delay in performance or failure to perform, in whole or in part, any of their obligations in connection with the services, where such delay or failure is due in part to fire, earthquake, weather, traffic, road construction, strikes, government sanctioned embargo, flood, act of God, act of war or terrorism, act of any public authority or sovereign government, civil disorder, delay caused by any air or ground passenger carrier, or any other circumstances beyond the reasonable control of KURO, its subcontractors or affiliates. </p>
<p><strong>Lost or Misplaced Items</strong></p>
<p>KURO assumes no liability for any lost or misplaced personal property or any other items. </p>
<p><strong>Written form requirement</strong></p>
<p>All additions, changes and side agreements must be in writing to be valid, i.e. in text form, by e-mail or by fax. Verbal special agreements become effective only if the clause on the written form requirement was previously waived in accordance with the clause. </p>
<p><strong>Changes in Terms</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide known Customers advance notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. </p>
<p><strong>Severability</strong></p>
<p>The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. Any invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed severed from these Terms to the extent of its invalidity or unenforceability, and these Terms shall be construed and enforced as if the Terms did not contain that particular provision to the extent of its invalidity or unenforceability. </p>
